![Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect Servo Board](https://github.com/iotdesignshop/dexhand-mechanical-build/blob/main/docs/images/electronics/alldone.jpg)

We've just released a BOM and How-To Guide for building up an Arduino-based controller board for the V1.0 DexHand. It is a compact design built with off-the-shelf prototyping parts from Adafruit and Arduino designed to fit into the forearm of the DexHand.

Features:
- Off the shelf parts (Adafruit and Arduino)
- Compact design to fit in the forearm of the DexHand
- Based on Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect (Raspberry Pi Nano)
- Controls all 18 servos in the DexHand with a single board
- Designed to work with our Firmware project (Bluetooth LE and Serial connections)
