# Origins of the DexHand Project - The Robot Studio and Rob Knight

The DexHand was originally envisioned, designed, and released by Rob Knight from [The Robot Studio](https://www.therobotstudio.com). The V1 DexHand was released to Open Source on GitHub and the [project can be found here](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/V1.0-Dexhand)

There is a tremendous amount of information and knowledge on The Robot Studio YouTube Channel with information about the DexHand and Rob's other work. It is highly recommended that you [visit their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@therobotstudio)

You can find Rob on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-knight-03443789/)


# Maintenance of this Page and Project - IoT Design Shop and Trent Shumay

This site, content, and several of the GitHub repositories and references are maintained by Trent Shumay from [IoT Design Shop](http://www.iotdesignshop.com).

The purpose of this content is try try aggregate all of the available DexHand materials into a single place so that people interested in the project can find a central reference for how to build and program their own DexHands, and to foster a community of creators that are applying the DexHand to their problems.

You can visit the [IoT Design Shop YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@iotdesignshop) to see videos of Trent's work. And you can find Trent on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trent-shumay-b0b0901/)
