# Welcome to DexHand.org
The DexHand project is a low-cost, open source, dexterous hand designed for research and development on humanoid robots. 

Our goal is for the DexHand to be the best open source hand project available, and a great dexterous hand for your robotic research and development activities.

# Quick Links to Important Project Resources
The following links provide easy access to important components of the DexHand project:

- [**DexHand V1.0 GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/V1.0-Dexhand) - Where it all began. The original repo from The Robot Studio with the original STL files, and links to the OnShape CAD models for the V1.0 DexHand. 
- [**DexHand-BLE Repository**](https://github.com/iotdesignshop/dexhand-ble) - Firmware for the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect and a Python Demo that uses Google MediaPipe Hand Tracker to analyze hand positions and play them back on a DexHand via Bluetooth LE. Runs on PC/Mac/Linux. 
- [**DexHand-Mechanical-Build**](https://github.com/iotdesignshop/dexhand-mechanical-build) - Collection of materials, instructions, and a build Wiki from IoT Design Shop containing details of their V1.0 DexHand build and some mods for ease of assembly and durability.
