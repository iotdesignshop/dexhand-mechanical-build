The DexHand project is a low-cost, open source, dexterous hand designed for research and development on humanoid robots. 

Our goal is for the DexHand to be the best open source hand project available, and a great dexterous hand for your robotic research and development activities.

## Origins of the DexHand and This Project

|[<img src="RobotStudio-Logo.png" width="300px">](http://www.therobotstudio.com)|The DexHand was envisioned and released to Open Source by [Rob Knight of The Robot Studio](https://www.therobotstudio.com). This remarkable work is one of many amazing projects Rob has created in over 20 years in robotics.|
|[<img src="IOT_Logo.png" width="200px">](http://www.iotdesignshop.com)|This site and content is maintained by [Trent Shumay from IoT Design Shop](http://www.iotdesignshop.com). Trent has built and tuned a DexHand in the IoT Shop and made it a goal to document this process.|

# Quick Links to Important Project Resources
The following links provide easy access to important components of the DexHand project:

- [**DexHand V1.0 GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/V1.0-Dexhand) - Where it all began. The original repo from The Robot Studio with the original STL files, and links to the OnShape CAD models for the V1.0 DexHand. 
- [**DexHand-BLE Repository**](https://github.com/iotdesignshop/dexhand-ble) - Firmware for the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect and a Python Demo that uses Google MediaPipe Hand Tracker to analyze hand positions and play them back on a DexHand via Bluetooth LE. Runs on PC/Mac/Linux. 
- [**DexHand-Mechanical-Build**](https://github.com/iotdesignshop/dexhand-mechanical-build) - Collection of materials, instructions, and a build Wiki from IoT Design Shop containing details of their V1.0 DexHand build and some mods for ease of assembly and durability.
- [**DexHand-ROS2-Meta**](https://github.com/iotdesignshop/dexhand_ros2_meta) - Home of the ROS 2 drivers and demonstration packages for the DexHand. We have a description package with URDF, a high-level gesture controller, and a new demonstration featuring ChatGPT using the DexHand as an output device. RVIZ2 simulations are available for testing the packages without a hardware hand.
